								<h2 class="major">Credit card <br/> fraud detection project</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/credit1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Overview of the project:</h3>
								<p>
									Utilizing machine learning algorithms to spot and stop fraudulent behaviors in credit card transactions is the goal of the project "credit card fraud detection". The initiative seeks to examine massive amounts of data produced by credit card transactions and find any unusual or suspect behavior that may point to fraudulent conduct.
								</p>
								<h3>Business context:</h3>
								<p>
									The financial institutions, banks, and credit card firms are continuously looking for ways to reduce the financial losses brought on by credit card fraud, which forms the business framework for this project. According to a survey by the Nilson survey, losses from credit card theft were $28.65 billion globally in 2020, and the amount is predicted to keep rising.
								</p>
								<h3>More information about the project:</h3>
								<p>
									Credit card companies and financial institutions are putting money into fraud detection systems that can spot suspected fraudulent transactions in real-time to combat this. By doing this, businesses can stop fraud from occurring, reduce financial losses, and keep their consumers' trust. Feature engineering, data preparation, and machine learning modeling methods are frequently used in credit card fraud detection projects. On a sizable dataset of credit card transactions, both valid and fraudulent transactions are included, machine learning models are developed.
								</p>
								<p>
									To forecast the likelihood that a transaction is fraudulent, the algorithms learn to spot patterns and anomalies in the data. After the models have been trained, they are put into use in a production setting where they may examine current credit card transactions and flag any that are suspect. The transactions that have been identified are next examined by fraud analysts, who decide whether they are honest or dishonest.
								</p>
								<p>
									In general, the credit card fraud detection project is a crucial tool for financial institutions and credit card firms to avoid financial losses and safeguard their clients from fraudulent actions.

								<h2 class="major">Rental management system</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/rent4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Overview of the project:</h3>
								<p>
									The management of rental properties, including keeping track of rent payments, maintenance requests, tenant communication, lease agreements, and financial reporting, is simplified by a software program called a <a href="#work2">rental management system</a>.
								</p>
								<h3>Business context:</h3>
								<p>
									For real estate agents, landlords, and property management businesses who manage many rental properties, a rental management system is crucial from a commercial perspective. By ensuring that rent is paid on time, maintenance requests are swiftly attended to, and tenants are successfully communicated with, this kind of software can assist these companies in managing their rental operations more effectively.								</p>
								<h3>More information about the project:</h3>
								<p>
									Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams are some of the UML diagrams that might be employed in this project. Class diagrams can display the relationships between classes and their properties and methods, whereas use case diagrams can show the actors and how they interact with the system. Sequence diagrams and activity diagrams both show how various parts of the system interact with one another. Activity diagrams also indicate how the flow of activities occurs inside the system.
								</p>
								<p>
									A rental management system can also automate many of the steps involved in the rental application process, such as tenant screening, credit checks, and background checks. Additionally, it offers financial reporting so that income, costs, and profit margins may be monitored.
								</p>
								<p>
									An effective tool for any company that owns or maintains rental properties is a rental management system. It enhances interaction with tenants, streamlines business processes, and makes sure that all financial transactions are accurately documented and recorded.

								<h2 class="major">Zoom: <br/> Cultivating Human Connection <br/> In a Digital World</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/zoom3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Technology has altered the way we communicate with one another in today's world. People may now connect from anywhere in the world thanks to digital platforms. Zoom is one such application that has recently grown in popularity. Zoom has established itself as a popular platform for virtual meetings, online classes, and distant business partnerships. However, the question is whether technology can assist us in cultivating human connection. This blog will look at how Zoom can help people connect in the digital age.
								</p>
								<p>
									Eric Yuan, the firm's designer, is acknowledged for Zoom's development for his affinity with human connection and dedication towards creating an enjoyable and straightforward communication tool. Yuan made Zoom more effective for fostering collaboration through video conversations because he understood the fact that confidence is the key to achieving team potential. His clients witnessed greater success because of this. Additionally, Yuan seized on the importance of happiness when he was establishing his business by appreciating it for his team and consumers alike.
                </p>
								<p>
									Zoom is much more pleasurable to use than any of its competitors, which is evident. Yuan built a business culture based on solid interpersonal ties that included family and close friends because she understood that love is the foundation of true connection. Because of this, his team was better equipped to produce a good that helped others find and maintain their love.
                </p>
								<p>
									A key part of our lives now involves video communication. People may now communicate in real time face to face, regardless of where they are located, thanks to Zoom. Everything changes as we switch on the camera. Both engagement and trust are increased as a result. Understanding gestures, body language, facial expressions, and accents are now possible through video communication, which is crucial for fostering interpersonal relationships. With over 45% of the market share and more than 350 million daily meeting participants in just five months during the Covid-19 epidemic in 2020, all of these variables contributed to Zoom's phenomenal success. This achievement has culminated in $622.7M in annual earnings.
                </p>
								<p>
									Communicating in person was the norm before the worldwide outbreak, and digital interaction was viewed as a fallback. But the pandemic has influenced how we communicate with one another. The new standard for communication is now digital. Video interaction has made it possible to foster a sense of community despite the physical separation.
								</p>
								<p>
									The success of Zoom can be linked to its capacity to foster interpersonal connections and the sharing of special occasions. Because of the company's concern with emotional connection, it has cracked the code for facilitating human interaction through online meetings, making it the preferred tool for both remote teams and close companions.
                </p>
								<p>
									Zoom's platform has simplified, streamlined, and widened access to digital interaction. The application's functionality encourages involved virtual dialogue and makes it user-friendly. With the help of Zoom's conference rooms, attendees may break up into smaller groups and have conversations just like they would. Because of Zoom's digital surroundings, digital interaction is fascinating and enjoyable.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let's sum up by emphasizing that modern technology has the potential to enhance human connection. Video communication has merged into our routines. Regardless of where they are positioned, one can now communicate with individuals in a context in real time using Zoom. Zoom has revolutionized our ability to communicate with one another and enhanced the convenience, efficacy, and pleasure of online encounters.
